Instructions:

First column: Time (in seconds).
Second column: Ping response time.

Takes a text file generated by command prompt after using the command: "ping [DNS] -t > data.txt".
After the ping has run for a sufficient amount of time, the first two lines in the text file must be manually deleted so that every line begins with "Reply from...".
Then, with the python script in the same folder as the data.txt file, the script can be run to generate a csv file that pairs each ping response time, to 1 second,
and thus can be thrown into Excel to create a ping over time graph.

How to convert to minutes/hours: If the data is being thrown into excel to create a graph of the data, you can enter the divisor into an empty cell in excel.
- 3600 if you wish to convert the seconds to hours
- 60 if you wish to convert the seconds to minutes.
Once this number (the divisor) is in an empty cell outside of the columns of data, you can right click on the cell and click copy. Then, select the entire column that
is just counting up from 0, and right click and chose "Paste Special", then chose "Divide", and then apply. This divides every cell by the divisor number, which in turn
converts the ping per second data, to ping per minute/hour.

Side note: I could not find a reliable source that outlines at what interval command prompt sends a ping, and thus I have estimated that it sends a ping about every
1 second, which is why in the generated csv file each response time (in the secpmd column) is paired with a multiple of 1 (in the first column).
